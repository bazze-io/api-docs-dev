## Getting Authorized

- Click the "Authorize" button in the top right corner of the page and enter our API Key in the pop-up, then click **Authorize**.  At this point the lock symbols on the page should be closed letting you know you are authorized for access.

Each of the lines with GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE in front of it is an _endpoint_.  Each _endpoint_ performs a specific action on the API.

For example, the first endpoint on the page is `/hello`.  This is a simple test endpoint just to check that the API is working and that you are authorized.
