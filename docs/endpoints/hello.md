### The /hello endpoint

- Click on the GET /hello endpoint and then on the **Try it out** button.  Then click the blue button that says **Execute**.  It will load for a second or two and then complete.  Scroll down to the section labeled **Response Body** and you should see the response from the API:

```json
{
  "Hello": "Swagger!"
}
```

- Click the top of the GET /hello drop down to minimize it after you are done.
